- A constructor is a method called by default when an object is created.
    - A constructor is used to set up an object in the early stages (when it first gets created).
- It's like a method that takes arguments for a class when the object is first created.
- By default, C# will create an empty constructor for you if you don't declare one.
- An empty constructor has no effect on the program.
- 'ctor' to create quickly.
- constructor overloading is when you create multiple constructors for 1 class, because you may not know everything about that object when you initialize it...
    - for example, when you create a Customer(), you may only know their ID, or name. Or, neither!

- constructors and inheritance:
    - by default, sub-classes not inherit the super class constructor, but cannot access private fields. to do this, you can use the :base() syntax.
    - If you make an object of a sub-class, the parent class constructor is called first by default.
