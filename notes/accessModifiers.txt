- In C#, there are 5 access modifiers.
    - Examples are public, private, protected, etc.
    - They are ways to "control" access to classes, and the members of the classes.
    - It creates safety to our programs and applications
    - lets take a look:
        class Person{
            private string Name;
        }
        ...
        var john = new Person();
        john.Name = "Johnny boy"; // this wont compile!!

- An app should be designed like a black box, this is -> the class should be easily accessible to the outside world (via an interface), and should hide what it does behind the scenes

- Public: accessible to everyone.
- Private: only accessible inside of the class, and not to the outside world.
- Protected: only accessible insdie of class, AND its derived classes.


- Encapsulation:
    - Encapsulation is about "hiding" details about a class that you dont want accessible to the public.
    - for example, imagine we had a private field in a class, and a public getter and setter method.
